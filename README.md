# Created a simple form using rjsf library
To render the form, the PersonalDetails component is used within form.tsx
The form schema only contains two properties, Name and age, when the user types them in and presses submit, 
it console logs the name and the age. 
The css is stored in app.css and I used Copliot to generate it using the C.R.A.F.T.E.D template.
